MISC:

check if I need parse_arguments

Renamings:

change set to array for edgeset and vertexset

FUNCTIONS:

edgeset_length
vertexset_length
array_length
inflow(vertex)
outflow(vertex)
exflow(vertex) = inflow - outflow
active(vertex) = exflow > 0
is_admissable(edge)
network_residual
float residualal_capacity(networkedge)  [done]
